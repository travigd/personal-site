# {ABOUT.title}

Dockerfiles are kind of weird to debug. They're fundamentally stateful (every
`RUN` depends on the previous commands).

For complex things, it's not always easy to figure out the exact state of the
image at a given point in the Dockerfile (most often for me, I need to figure
out where certain files were installed).

# Pre-BuildKit

With pre-BuildKit docker, this was pretty easy. Docker would always create
intermediate images for every step of the Dockerfile and print out the
short-SHAs of those images.

Let's use this simple Dockerfile as an example and see what happens when we
build it:

```
# Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
RUN pip3 install numpy
```

By disabling BuildKit, we get the old behavior:

```
$ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build .

Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.048kB

Removing intermediate container 7caa3a90fa96

Step 3/3 : RUN pip3 install numpy
 ---> Running in facf18bce582
/bin/sh: 1: pip3: not found
The command '/bin/sh -c pip3 install numpy' returned a non-zero code: 127
(base)
```

Notable, the ` ---> c47ed9aec5f6` line indicates that a temporary image was
exported with the SHA `c47ed9aec5f6`. The way this works under the hood is by
creating a container based on the previous layers image, running the command in
the container, and then exporting that container as a new image (Ã  la the
`docker export` command) &mdash; that's why we also see the
`Removing intermediate container 7caa3a90fa96` line in the output.

In this example, step 3 fails, but we can spin up the image as it was after step
2 with a simple `docker run c47ed9aec5f6` command:

```
$ docker run -it --rm c47ed9aec5f6 bash

root@7dcf5ca5ac35:/# which pip3
root@7dcf5ca5ac35:/# echo $?
1
```

In this example, it's pretty obvious that the issue that `pip3` isn't installed,
but more complex situations might involve more rooting around.

## With BuildKit

BuildKit doesn't export intermediate layers, so we can't use the same trick as
above. There's a slightly more involved trick we can use, though, using
multi-stage builds[^multi-stage-builds].

[^multi-stage-builds]:
    Note that a **step** in a Dockerfile corresponds to a single instruction
    (e.g., a `RUN` or `ADD` command). A **stage** is a grouping of steps
    starting from a `FROM` command`and ending with the next`FROM` command (or
    the end of the Dockerfile). Most Dockerfiles only have one stage, but some
    have more (e.g., to build a binary in one stage and then copy it into a
    smaller stage that doesn't have all the build tools installed).

```
# Dockerfile (updated!)
FROM ubuntu:20.04 AS tmp

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

FROM tmp
RUN pip3 install numpy
```

Now we've named our first build stage `tmp`. We add the `FROM tmp` line just
_before_ the `RUN` command that isn't working.

Now we can build just the `tmp` stage:

```
$ docker build . --target tmp

and we can run with:

```

$ docker run -it --rm 2954b5e4cda897c1767728ad00de75dab8b4950251fb6fdc8eb1d30468d4301b

root@fd3a4bf0046f:/# which pip3
root@fd3a4bf0046f:/# echo $?
1
```

A little more work, but not toooooo bad. Just remember to remove the `AS tmp`
and `FROM tmp` lines when you're done debugging (they won't hurt anything, but
you probably don't want to commit them).

## Why not just disable BuildKit?

Many answers on StackOverflow just suggest disabling BuildKit with
`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` and then using the old behavior. This works fine.

The reason you might **not** want to do that is mostly just that BuildKit is
faster and doesn't share any cache with non-BuildKit builds. So if you're trying
to debug the last stage of a build, and you set `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0`, it'll have
to rebuild the entire image from scratch.

Do whatever works for you
[(and hopefully debugging BuildKit issues will get a little easier in the future...)](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/1472).
